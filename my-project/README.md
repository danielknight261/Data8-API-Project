Loose Plan:
Step 1: Connect to API Using POSTMAN with successful response ✅
Step 2:Begin the build , Establish simple connecting using JSON Endpoint 
"https://webservices.data-8.co.uk/EmailValidation/IsValid.json" and return Syntax level ✅

Step 2.1: Define states, email, errors, submission and response ✅
Step 3: Include all 4 of the search option (update state, define array and update data object) ✅
Step 4:Make the input and response layout cleaner "textarea" is not correct choice. ✅
Step 5: Seems to be running into an issue when using the same email changing the level and then submitting, refresh button maybe useful. ✅
Step 6: Add Key to an ENV file,   ✅
Step 7: host on vercel ✅
Step 8: upgrade documentation
Step 9: Better use of error handling

Stretch Goals:
Look further into the advanced options.
Link to a backend, perhaps MongoDB. Previously built a user management system that included name, age, email. It would be interesting to see how this works in connection with a database.
